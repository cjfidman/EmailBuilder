# EmailBuilder

This simple GUI allows the user to send an identical email to a list of contacts, while 
addressing each individual personally at the beginning of the email. The application is limited to 
sending from gmail.

For example:
Dear Mr. Cunningham, is replaced by Dear Mr. Washington, while the remainder of the email stays the same. 

To accomplish this the application draws input from two files: clients.csv and letter.docx

client.csv
  column 1 = Title/First name
  column 2 = Last name
  column 3 = email address
